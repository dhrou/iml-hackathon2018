# title: A-CATCHY-TITLE-FOR-YOUR-PROJECT

## problem to solve

Give us some background. What are you wondering about? What unsolved question
do you want to shed light on? Which bug are you trying to fix / missing feature
to provide?

## desired outcome

What do you aim for?

 - A pull request to a software project?
 - A human readable document to document a workflow/ML method/an interface?
 - A jupyter notebook?
 - Having educated yourself, having tried a new tool?
 - Having explored "what happens when I do X"? Something you always wanted to know but haven't found somebody else try.

## looking for know-how

Do you think you need an expert for your project? Would you profit from having an expert around who knows the internals of the TMVA Gui or scikit-learn's module structure?

## preparation

People who join your project might enjoy the project more if the come prepared.

Please keep the entry barrier low. It would be sad if only people who write
CUDA on a daily basis find satisfying projects.

Is there:

 - a software one can install prior to the hackathon?
 - a dataset to download?
 - some initial questions to think about? a paper to read?

## further reading, anything else

Is there anything that doesn't fit any of the above?

You can edit the description of the pull request in the future.
