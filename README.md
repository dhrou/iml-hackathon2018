## purpose of this repository

We would like the hackathon to work with little moderation from the IML
coordinators side. E.g. hacking projects should not be submitted to and then
approved by us, proposals should be visible to all participants to give
feedback, make suggestions, etc.

## how to propose a project

Our Idea is to have projects submitted as pull requests. ([How to create pull requests][prhowto])The actual content of
the pull request is not so important at this stage (just create a subdirectory
and put useful files inside) the main discussion and attraction of participants
should happen in the pull request discussion.

There is a template for pull request descriptions in place, the general idea is to describe:

 - What do you want to do? What is the project about?
 - Will you work on the project yourself or is it a suggestion for somebody to pick up?
 - What prerequesits should/could participants bring with them? / What kind of know-how are you lacking that ideally a participant would contribute (Maybe you want to add a functionality to your favourite ML library and it would be good to know your way around its source code?)
 - Are there previous works to build upon? Is there something that can be prepared in advance (set up software installation / download dataset)?

## outcome

Whatever it is your project aims for (a study, a learning experience, a new
tool, a feature to an existing tool) we would be happy if you can present
your achievement in one of the upcoming IML meetings.
